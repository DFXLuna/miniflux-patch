type: release

* Reverted PR #1290 (follow the only link) because it leads to several panics/segfaults that prevent feed updates
* Disable double-tap mobile gesture if swipe gesture is disabled
* Skip integrations if there are no entries to push
* Enable TLS-ALPN-01 challenge for ACME
    - This type of challenge works purely at the TLS layer and is compatible
    with SNI proxies. The existing HTTP-01 challenge support has been left
    as-is.
* Preconfigure Miniflux for GitHub Codespaces
* Updated `golang.org/x/net/*` dependencies
